# 0x06. Unittests in JS

## Project Overview
The "0x06. Unittests in JS" project focuses on creating unit tests for JavaScript code. Testing ensures code quality and reliability by verifying that individual components behave as expected. In this project, you'll use Mocha, a popular JavaScript testing framework, to write and run unit tests for backend applications built with Node.js and Express.js.

This project introduces you to the best practices in testing, including test-driven development (TDD), and equips you with the skills to identify and resolve bugs early in the development process.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you will:
- Understand the importance of unit testing in software development.
- Learn how to use Mocha, a JavaScript testing framework, to write test cases.
- Write test cases for backend applications built with Node.js and Express.js.
- Work with JavaScript ES6 features, including arrow functions, modules, and destructuring.
- Embrace TDD principles for designing robust and maintainable applications.

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building server-side applications.
- **Express.js**: Web application framework for Node.js.
- **Mocha**: JavaScript testing framework for running tests.
