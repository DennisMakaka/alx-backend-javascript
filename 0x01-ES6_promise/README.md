# 0x01. ES6 Promises

This project explores **ES6 Promises** and their use in asynchronous JavaScript programming. It focuses on how to handle asynchronous operations using `Promise`, `async/await`, and related methods like `then`, `catch`, and `resolve`.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to:

- Understand how to work with Promises in JavaScript.
- Use the `then`, `resolve`, and `catch` methods for handling Promises.
- Apply `try/catch` and `throw` for error handling in asynchronous code.
- Work with `async/await` for more readable asynchronous functions.
- Leverage Promise objects for more complex asynchronous workflows.

## Requirements

- All code is executed on **Ubuntu 18.04 LTS** using **NodeJS 12.11.x**.
- You can use any of the following editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`, or **Visual Studio Code**.
- All files should end with a new line.
- Code must adhere to **ESLint** standards.
- All functions must be exported and tested using **Jest**.

## Setup

### Install NodeJS 12.11.x

```bash
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x -o nodesource_setup.sh
